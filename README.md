teensyUSBtoPS2
==============

Simple Arduino based USB to AT/PS2 keyboard converter.

### Status

Experimental

### About

This uses a Teensy 3.2 microcontroller, and a UHS mini pro ( USB Host Shield mini ) to process incoming usb keyboard interactions and output the PS2 keyboard signals. 

I am targeting my:
  GR8BIT MSX computer that uses a PS2 keyboard.

This can be built using the same hardware as my TI 99 USB Keys adapter. (just output to an AT 5pin DIN, or PS2 6pin DIN instead of simulating the TI-99/4a matrix keyboard)
