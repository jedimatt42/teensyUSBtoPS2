teensyUSBtoPS2
==============

Simple Arduino based USB to AT/PS2 keyboard converter.

### Status

Experimental

### About

This uses a Teensy 3.2 microcontroller, and a UHS mini pro ( USB Host Shield mini ) to process incoming usb keyboard interactions and output the XT keyboard signals. 

I am targeting my:
  GR8BIT MSX computer that uses a PS2 keyboard.

This can be built using the same hardware as my TI 99 USB Keys adapter. (just output to a XT 5pin DIN instead of simulating the TI-99/4a matrix keyboard)
